fetched.

What the purpose of this fork is provide a enviroment so I can build firmware for my rev 2 Preonic.

You can build the firmware of any of the provided keyboard, as long as it does not depend on any files in a 
branch other than master as that is the only branch included in this fork.

Building firmware is done on unix-like system, i.e.: linux, mac, or wsl.
